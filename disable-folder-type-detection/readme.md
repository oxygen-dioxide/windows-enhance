## Disable folder type detection
[Download this script](disable-folder-type-detection.reg)

Windows automatically detects the type of each folder by default. For example, it shows "artists" and "album" for a folder that is recognized as a "music folder".

However, if you are a musician who deals with a lot of `.mid` files, or an audio engineer, you may find "artists" and "album" totally useless compared to the type, size and the time of modification that windows shows for a "normal folder".

This .reg disables the auto-detection of folder types in windows globally so that every folder will be recognized as a "normal folder" no matter what it contains.
